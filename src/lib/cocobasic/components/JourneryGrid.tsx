        <p>
          In 2019, I arrived in Canada to pursue a Studio Arts diploma. My
          journey, however, didn’t begin as smoothly as I had hoped. My initial
          application was rejected because my portfolio wasn’t strong enough,
          and I wasn’t fully aware of how competitive the program would be. It
          felt like a setback, but then something unexpected happened—my advisor
          reached out, letting me know that the program still needed more
          applicants. They gave me a chance to reapply within a month with a
          completely new portfolio.
        </p>

        <p>
          I poured my heart into creating a fresh body of work, pushing my
          creativity to new limits. My efforts paid off—not only did I receive
          the acceptance letter, but I also earned a scholarship. That moment
          was a turning point, reinforcing that persistence and resilience can
          indeed shape new opportunities.

          As a newcomer to the Canadian art scene, I felt a bit lost, unsure of
          how to make my mark. I began selling paintings on Whyte Avenue street,
          standing front of a “wee book inn” book store.. during weekends.
          Although I did sell a few, it was a short-lived venture as the
          pandemic soon hit. Navigating the art world as a new artist wasn’t
          easy. Galleries seemed out of reach, and I had no connections to guide
          me. I kept searching for a stable path, wondering how I could sustain
          myself through art. Selling paintings felt unpredictable—either
          someone loved it and bought it, or they just walked by. I needed
          something more consistent.

          Tattooing entered my life almost by accident. It wasn’t something I
          had ever envisioned for myself, but one night, the idea just sparked
          in my mind. I decided to give it a try. That spontaneous decision led
          me to FX INC—the very last tattoo and piercing studio I approached,
          almost ready to give up. I had no portfolio, no idea how to apply for
          jobs, and little knowledge of the tattoo industry. But FX INC gave me
          a chance—a space to learn, grow, and develop my skills through an
          apprenticeship that lasted around 14 to 16 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tattoo industry taught me a lot about trust—the trust that clients
          place in your work. It’s not just about meeting expectations; it’s
          about striving to exceed them. Every project, no matter how small or
          big, became a lesson in persistence and growth.

          One day, my senior piercer casually asked if I’d be interested in
          learning how to pierce. I thought, “Why not?” Little did I know that
          piercing would open up a new layer of creativity for me. I hadn’t
          realized how a single, precise poke could make such a significant
          difference in someone’s self-expression. Designing a human body
          through piercing felt like adding thoughtful details to a canvas—each
          piece becoming a part of how they choose to represent themselves.
